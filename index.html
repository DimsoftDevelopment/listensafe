        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Noise-induced hearing loss is irreversible. If unaddressed, hearing
            damage can have a big impact on a person's quality of life and
            mental well-being in the long term.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          On this page we will focus on ways in which safe listening practices
          can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and outline some
          recommendations.
        </p>
        <h2>Noise-induced hearing loss</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Noise-induced hearing damage can happen suddenly, but in most cases,
            it occurs gradually over time. </strong
          >The first indication of hearing damage is often tinnitus, which is a
          persistent ringing or buzzing in the ear. Another indication is that
          you might notice that sounds become distorted or muffled, and it can
          become challenging to understand what others are saying, especially in
          noisy environments like restaurants. You might also feel the need to
          turn up the volume on the TV to hear it better.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gradual hearing damage is permanent but may go unnoticed in the
          early stages. It can lead to challenges, such as difficulty
          understanding speech, especially when there is background noise, or
          distinguishing different sounds, such as multiple voices in a
          conversation. It can also lead to reduced hearing quality, which means
          that sounds may become distorted and less clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tinnitus can lead to sleep disturbance, emotional distress, reduced
          social interaction and diminished enjoyment of listening activities,
          such as watching a movie or listening to music. Tinnitus can lead to
          sleep disturbance, emotional distress, reduced social interaction and
          diminished enjoyment of listening activities, such as watching a movie
          or listening to music.
        </p>
        <h2>Unsafe listening</h2>
        <p>
          When we think of hearing damage we often associate it with “industrial
          noise exposure” (e.g., from machinery, power tools, etc), however
          recreational sound exposure can be just as dangerous. It’s important
          to understand that
          <strong>
            listening to any sound at a very high volume for a long time will
            lead to permanent hearing loss and/or tinnitus.
          </strong>
          There are many musicians and people who work in the music industry who
          have experienced severe hearing damage because they were exposed to
          very loud sounds for extended periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Listening to sounds at 80 dB for 40 hours a week is the limit of
            safe listening.
          </strong>
          For reference, the noise of heavy traffic heard from inside a vehicle
          is equivalent to 80 dB.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some activities that pose risks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Listening to music at high volume when using earbuds or headphones
          </li>
          <li>Video gaming using headphones</li>
          <li>
            Regular or prolonged visits to loud entertainment venues such as
            music concerts or nightclubs, which can be as loud as 110 dB!
          </li>
          <li>Riding motorcycles</li>
          <li>Shooting/hunting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Safe listening behaviors</h2>
        <p>
          Exposure to loud sounds usually causes temporary fatigue to the
          delicate parts of our inner ear, namely the sensory cells (inner and
          outer hair cells). This is why after you attend a loud situation, such
          as a live show or nightclub, you may notice your hearing ability is
          reduced and you might notice ringing or buzzing in your ears. Whilst
          for most people, this reduced hearing ability returns to normal over a
          day or two, continued loud noise exposure over time is likely to
          result in permanent damage to these cells (also known as noise-induced
          hearing loss). Here are some safe listening behaviors that can help us
          prevent noise-induced hearing loss:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Keep the volume down:
            <ul>
              <li>Set your device’s volume level to a maximum of 60%.</li>
              <li>Use well-fitted noise cancelling headphones.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Protect your ears from loud sounds.
            <ul>
              <li>
                In noisy places, wear earplugs and move away from loudspeakers.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Limit the time spent engaged in noisy activities
            <ul>
              <li>Limit the use of personal audio devices.</li>
              <li>
                In a noisy place, it is important to take regular breaks and
                move to a quiet area.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor listening levels of your devices:
            <ul>
              <li>Use apps to monitor your sound exposure.</li>
              <li>
                Choose devices which have built-in safe listening features.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

          <li>
            Book a doctor’s appointment if you have persistent ringing in the
            ear (tinnitus) or experience difficulties hearing high-pitched
            sounds or following conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check your hearing regularly: With the hearWHO app you can check
            your hearing using your mobile phone. Shall you have signs of
            hearing loss, please seek professional advice (i.e. speak with an
            audiologist or visit a medical center).
